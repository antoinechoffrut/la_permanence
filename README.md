# Attendance at *La Permanence* coworking space #

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[La Permanence](https://www.la-permanence.com "La Permanence coworking
space in Paris") offers two coworking spaces in Paris, in *rue du
Fer à Moulin* and *rue d'Alésia*.

This project monitors the number of available seats at the two
locations and performs some simple analysis.  The data is collected
with the script `la_permanence_scraping.py` and saved in
`attendance.csv` (which is a misnomer, since it records the number of
available seats rather than the number of seats used).
The Jupyter Notebook `la_permanence_EDA.ipynb` performs some simple
analysis of the data.
